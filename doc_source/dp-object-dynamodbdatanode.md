# DynamoDBDataNode<a name="dp-object-dynamodbdatanode"></a>

 Defines a data node using DynamoDB, which is specified as an input to a `HiveActivity` or `EMRActivity` object\. 

**Note**  
The `DynamoDBDataNode` object does not support the `Exists` precondition\.

## Example<a name="dynamodbdatanode-example"></a>

The following is an example of this object type\. This object references two other objects that you'd define in the same pipeline definition file\. `CopyPeriod` is a `Schedule` object and `Ready` is a precondition object\.

```
{
  "id" : "MyDynamoDBTable",
  "type" : "DynamoDBDataNode",
  "schedule" : { "ref" : "CopyPeriod" },
  "tableName" : "adEvents",
  "precondition" : { "ref" : "Ready" }
}
```

| Required Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| tableName | The DynamoDB table\. | String | 


****  

| Object Invocation Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| schedule | This object is invoked within the execution of a schedule interval\. Users must specify a schedule reference to another object to set the dependency execution order for this object\. Users can satisfy this requirement by explicitly setting a schedule on the object, for example, by specifying "schedule": \{"ref": "DefaultSchedule"\}\. In most cases, it is better to put the schedule reference on the default pipeline object so that all objects inherit that schedule\. Or, if the pipeline has a tree of schedules \(schedules within the master schedule\), users can create a parent object that has a schedule reference\. For more information about example optional schedule configurations, see [Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-object-schedule.html)\. | Reference Object, for example, "schedule":\{"ref":"myScheduleId"\} | 


****  

| Optional Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| attemptStatus | Most recently reported status from the remote activity\. | String | 
| attemptTimeout | Timeout for remote work completion\. If this field is set, then a remote activity that does not complete within the set time of starting may be retried\. | Period | 
| dataFormat | DataFormat for the data described by this data node\. Currently supported for HiveActivity and HiveCopyActivity\. | Reference Object, "dataFormat":\{"ref":"myDynamoDBDataFormatId"\} | 
| dependsOn | Specify dependency on another runnable object | Reference Object, e\.g\. "dependsOn":\{"ref":"myActivityId"\} | 
| failureAndRerunMode | Describes consumer node behavior when dependencies fail or are rerun | Enumeration | 
| lateAfterTimeout | The elapsed time after pipeline start within which the object must start\. It is triggered only when the schedule type is not set to ondemand\. | Period | 
| maxActiveInstances | The maximum number of concurrent active instances of a component\. Re\-runs do not count toward the number of active instances\. | Integer | 
| maximumRetries | Maximum number attempt retries on failure | Integer | 
| onFail | An action to run when current object fails\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onFail":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| onLateAction | Actions that should be triggered if an object has not yet been scheduled or still not completed\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onLateAction":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| onSuccess | An action to run when current object succeeds\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onSuccess":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| parent | Parent of the current object from which slots will be inherited\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "parent":\{"ref":"myBaseObjectId"\} | 
| pipelineLogUri | The S3 URI \(such as 's3://BucketName/Key/'\) for uploading logs for the pipeline\. | String | 
| precondition | Optionally define a precondition\. A data node is not marked "READY" until all preconditions have been met\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "precondition":\{"ref":"myPreconditionId"\} | 
| readThroughputPercent | Sets the rate of read operations to keep your DynamoDB provisioned throughput rate in the allocated range for your table\. The value is a double between 0\.1 and 1\.0, inclusively\. | Double | 
| region | The code for the region where the DynamoDB table exists\. For example, us\-east\-1\. This is used by HiveActivity when it performs staging for DynamoDB tables in Hive\. | Enumeration | 
| reportProgressTimeout | Timeout for remote work successive calls to reportProgress\. If set, then remote activities that do not report progress for the specified period may be considered stalled and so retried\. | Period | 
| retryDelay | The timeout duration between two retry attempts\. | Period | 
| runsOn | The computational resource to run the activity or command\. For example, an Amazon EC2 instance or Amazon EMR cluster\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "runsOn":\{"ref":"myResourceId"\} | 
| scheduleType | Schedule type allows you to specify whether the objects in your pipeline definition should be scheduled at the beginning of interval or end of the interval\. Time Series Style Scheduling means instances are scheduled at the end of each interval and Cron Style Scheduling means instances are scheduled at the beginning of each interval\. An on\-demand schedule allows you to run a pipeline one time per activation\. This means you do not have to clone or re\-create the pipeline to run it again\. If you use an on\-demand schedule it must be specified in the default object and must be the only scheduleType specified for objects in the pipeline\. To use on\-demand pipelines, you simply call the ActivatePipeline operation for each subsequent run\. Values are: cron, ondemand, and timeseries\. | Enumeration | 
| workerGroup | The worker group\. This is used for routing tasks\. If you provide a runsOn value and workerGroup exists, workerGroup is ignored\. | String | 
| writeThroughputPercent | Sets the rate of write operations to keep your DynamoDB provisioned throughput rate in the allocated range for your table\. The value is a double between \.1 and 1\.0, inclusively\. | Double |
