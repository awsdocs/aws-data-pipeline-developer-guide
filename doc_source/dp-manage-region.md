# Using a Pipeline with Resources in Multiple Regions<a name="dp-manage-region"></a>

By default, the `Ec2Resource` and `EmrCluster` resources run in the same region as AWS Data Pipeline, however AWS Data Pipeline supports the ability to orchestrate data flows across multiple regions, such as running resources in one region that consolidate input data from another region\. By allowing resources to run a specified region, you also have the flexibility to co\-locate your resources with their dependent datasets and maximize performance by reducing latencies and avoiding cross\-region data transfer charges\. You can configure resources to run in a different region than AWS Data Pipeline by using the `region` field on `Ec2Resource` and `EmrCluster`\. 

The following example pipeline JSON file shows how to run an `EmrCluster` resource in the EU \(Ireland\) region, assuming that a large amount of data for the cluster to work on exists in the same region\. In this example, the only difference from a typical pipeline is that the `EmrCluster` has a `region` field value set to `eu-west-1`\.

```
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "Hourly",
      "type": "Schedule",
      "startDateTime": "2014-11-19T07:48:00",
      "endDateTime": "2014-11-21T07:48:00",
      "period": "1 hours"
    },
    {
      "id": "MyCluster",
      "type": "EmrCluster",
      "masterInstanceType": "m3.medium",
      "region": "eu-west-1",
      "schedule": {
        "ref": "Hourly"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "MyEmrActivity",
      "type": "EmrActivity",
      "schedule": {
        "ref": "Hourly"
      },
      "runsOn": {
        "ref": "MyCluster"
      },
      "step": "/home/hadoop/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar,-input,s3n://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/input,-output,s3://eu-west-1-bucket/wordcount/output/#{@scheduledStartTime},-mapper,s3n://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/wordSplitter.py,-reducer,aggregate"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following table lists the regions that you can choose and the associated region codes to use in the `region` field\. 

**Note**  
The following list includes regions in which AWS Data Pipeline can orchestrate workflows and launch Amazon EMR or Amazon EC2 resources\. AWS Data Pipeline may not be supported in these regions\. For information about regions in which AWS Data Pipeline is supported, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#datapipeline_region)\.
