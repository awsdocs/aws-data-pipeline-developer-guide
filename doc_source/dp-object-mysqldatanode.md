# MySqlDataNode<a name="dp-object-mysqldatanode"></a>

 Defines a data node using MySQL\. 

**Note**  
The `MySqlDataNode` type is deprecated\. We recommend that you use [SqlDataNode](dp-object-sqldatanode.md) instead\.

## Example<a name="mysqldatanode-example"></a>

The following is an example of this object type\. This object references two other objects that you'd define in the same pipeline definition file\. `CopyPeriod` is a `Schedule` object and `Ready` is a precondition object\.

```
{
  "id" : "Sql Table",
  "type" : "MySqlDataNode",
  "schedule" : { "ref" : "CopyPeriod" },
  "table" : "adEvents",
  "username": "user_name",
  "*password": "my_password",
  "connectionString": "jdbc:mysql://mysqlinstance-rds.example.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/database_name",
  "selectQuery" : "select * from #{table} where eventTime >= '#{@scheduledStartTime.format('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')}' and eventTime < '#{@scheduledEndTime.format('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')}'",
  "precondition" : { "ref" : "Ready" }
}
```

****  

| Required Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| table | The name of the table in the MySQL database\. | String | 


****  

| Object Invocation Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| schedule | This object is invoked within the execution of a schedule interval\. Users must specify a schedule reference to another object to set the dependency execution order for this object\. Users can satisfy this requirement by explicitly setting a schedule on the object, for example, by specifying "schedule": \{"ref": "DefaultSchedule"\}\. In most cases, it is better to put the schedule reference on the default pipeline object so that all objects inherit that schedule\. Or, if the pipeline has a tree of schedules \(schedules within the master schedule\), users can create a parent object that has a schedule reference\. For more information about example optional schedule configurations, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-object-schedule.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-object-schedule.html) | Reference Object, e\.g\. "schedule":\{"ref":"myScheduleId"\} | 


****  

| Optional Fields | Description | Slot Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| attemptStatus | Most recently reported status from the remote activity\. | String | 
| attemptTimeout | Timeout for remote work completion\. If set then a remote activity that does not complete within the set time of starting may be retried\. | Period | 
| createTableSql | An SQL create table expression that creates the table\. | String | 
| database | The name of the database\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "database":\{"ref":"myDatabaseId"\} | 
| dependsOn | Specifies dependency on another runnable object\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "dependsOn":\{"ref":"myActivityId"\} | 
| failureAndRerunMode | Describes consumer node behavior when dependencies fail or are rerun\. | Enumeration | 
| insertQuery | An SQL statement to insert data into the table\. | String | 
| lateAfterTimeout | The elapsed time after pipeline start within which the object must start\. It is triggered only when the schedule type is not set to ondemand\. | Period | 
| maxActiveInstances | The maximum number of concurrent active instances of a component\. Re\-runs do not count toward the number of active instances\. | Integer | 
| maximumRetries | Maximum number attempt retries on failure | Integer | 
| onFail | An action to run when current object fails\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onFail":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| onLateAction | Actions that should be triggered if an object has not yet been scheduled or still not completed\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onLateAction":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| onSuccess | An action to run when current object succeeds\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "onSuccess":\{"ref":"myActionId"\} | 
| parent | Parent of the current object from which slots will be inherited\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "parent":\{"ref":"myBaseObjectId"\} | 
| pipelineLogUri | The S3 URI \(such as 's3://BucketName/Key/'\) for uploading logs for the pipeline\. | String | 
| precondition | Optionally define a precondition\. A data node is not marked "READY" until all preconditions have been met\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "precondition":\{"ref":"myPreconditionId"\} | 
| reportProgressTimeout | Timeout for remote work successive calls to reportProgress\. If set, then remote activities that do not report progress for the specified period may be considered stalled and so retried\. | Period | 
| retryDelay | The timeout duration between two retry attempts\. | Period | 
| runsOn | The computational resource to run the activity or command\. For example, an Amazon EC2 instance or Amazon EMR cluster\. | Reference Object, e\.g\. "runsOn":\{"ref":"myResourceId"\} | 
| scheduleType | Schedule type allows you to specify whether the objects in your pipeline definition should be scheduled at the beginning of interval or end of the interval\. Time Series Style Scheduling means instances are scheduled at the end of each interval and Cron Style Scheduling means instances are scheduled at the beginning of each interval\. An on\-demand schedule allows you to run a pipeline one time per activation\. This means you do not have to clone or re\-create the pipeline to run it again\. If you use an on\-demand schedule it must be specified in the default object and must be the only scheduleType specified for objects in the pipeline\. To use on\-demand pipelines, you simply call the ActivatePipeline operation for each subsequent run\. Values are: cron, ondemand, and timeseries\. | Enumeration | 
| schemaName | The name of the schema holding the table | String | 
| selectQuery | A SQL statement to fetch data from the table\. | String | 
| workerGroup | The worker group\. This is used for routing tasks\. If you provide a runsOn value and workerGroup exists, workerGroup is ignored\. | String |
