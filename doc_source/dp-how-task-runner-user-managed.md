# Executing Work on Existing Resources Using Task Runner<a name="dp-how-task-runner-user-managed"></a>

You can install Task Runner on computational resources that you manage, such as an Amazon EC2 instance, or a physical server or workstation\. Task Runner can be installed anywhere, on any compatible hardware or operating system, provided that it can communicate with the AWS Data Pipeline web service\.

This approach can be useful when, for example, you want to use AWS Data Pipeline to process data that is stored inside your organizationâ€™s firewall\. By installing Task Runner on a server in the local network, you can access the local database securely and then poll AWS Data Pipeline for the next task to run\. When AWS Data Pipeline ends processing or deletes the pipeline, the Task Runner instance remains running on your computational resource until you manually shut it down\. The Task Runner logs persist after pipeline execution is complete\. 

To use Task Runner on a resource that you manage, you must first download Task Runner, and then install it on your computational resource, using the procedures in this section\. 

**Note**  
 You can only install Task Runner on Linux, UNIX, or macOS\. Task Runner is not supported on the Windows operating system\. 

To connect a Task Runner that you've installed to the pipeline activities it should process, add a `workerGroup` field to the object, and configure Task Runner to poll for that worker group value\. You do this by passing the worker group string as a parameter \(for example, `--workerGroup=wg-12345`\) when you run the Task Runner JAR file\.

## Installing Task Runner<a name="dp-installing-taskrunner"></a>

This section explains how to install and configure Task Runner and its prerequisites\. Installation is a straightforward manual process\.

**To install Task Runner**

1. Task Runner requires Java versions 1\.6 or 1\.8\. To determine whether Java is installed, and the version that is running, use the following command:

   ```
   java -version
   ```

    If you do not have Java 1\.6 or 1\.8 installed on your computer, download one of these versions from [http://www\.oracle\.com/technetwork/java/index\.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)\. Download and install Java, and then proceed to the next step\.

1. Download `TaskRunner-1.0.jar` from [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/datapipeline\-us\-east\-1/us\-east\-1/software/latest/TaskRunner/TaskRunner\-1\.0\.jar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/datapipeline-us-east-1/us-east-1/software/latest/TaskRunner/TaskRunner-1.0.jar) and then copy it into a folder on the target computing resource\. For Amazon EMR clusters running `EmrActivity` tasks, install Task Runner on the master node of the cluster\.

1.  Task Runner needs to connect to the AWS Data Pipeline web service to process your commands\. In this step, you configure Task Runner with an AWS account that has permissions to create or manage data pipelines\. 

   Create a JSON file named `credentials.json` \(you can use a different name if you prefer\), which specifies an access key ID and secret access key using the format `{ "access-id": "MyAccessKeyID", "private-key": "MySecretAccessKey" } `\. Copy the file to the directory where you installed Task Runner\. 

    For CLI access, you need an access key ID and secret access key\. Use IAM user access keys instead of AWS account root user access keys\. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account\. For more information about creating access keys, see [Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\. 

1. Task Runner connects to the AWS Data Pipeline web service using HTTPS\. If you are using an AWS resource, ensure that HTTPS is enabled in the appropriate routing table and subnet ACL\. If you are using a firewall or proxy, ensure that port 443 is open\.

## Starting Task Runner<a name="dp-activate-task-runner"></a>

In a new command prompt window that is set to the directory where you installed Task Runner, start Task Runner with the following command\.

```
java -jar TaskRunner-1.0.jar --config ~/credentials.json --workerGroup=myWorkerGroup --region=MyRegion --logUri=s3://mybucket/foldername
```

The `--config` option points to your credentials file\.

The `--workerGroup` option specifies the name of your worker group, which must be the same value as specified in your pipeline for tasks to be processed\.

The `--region` option specifies the service region from which to pull tasks to execute\.

The `--logUri` option is used for pushing your compressed logs to a location in Amazon S3\.

When Task Runner is active, it prints the path to where log files are written in the terminal window\. The following is an example\.

```
Logging to /Computer_Name/.../output/logs
```

Task Runner should be run detached from your login shell\. If you are using a terminal application to connect to your computer, you may need to use a utility like nohup or screen to prevent the Task Runner application from exiting when you log out\. For more information about command line options, see [Task Runner Configuration Options](dp-taskrunner-config-options.md)\.

## Verifying Task Runner Logging<a name="dp-verify-task-runner"></a>

The easiest way to verify that Task Runner is working is to check whether it is writing log files\. Task Runner writes hourly log files to the directory, `output/logs`, under the directory where Task Runner is installed\. The file name is `Task Runner.log.YYYY-MM-DD-HH`, where HH runs from 00 to 23, in UDT\. To save storage space, any log files older than eight hours are compressed with GZip\.
